        <div id="p_content">
            <p>Cronometer is the most accurate, comprehensive nutrition tracking app on earth. Unlike other apps on the
                market, our nutritional data is curated from verified, accurate sources. We aim to provide a complete
                solution – no matter what diet you choose to be on.</p>
            <p> Our CEO, Aaron Davidson, built Cronometer as a side project in 2005. He was following the CRON diet
                (Calorie Restriction with Optimal Nutrition) and being the nutrition nerd/software developer that he is,
                decided to build an app to track his diet. Thus, Cronometer was born. It was several years later before
                he came to the conclusion that maybe he was onto something and quit his six-figure corporate job to
                focus on improving Cronometer. </p>
            <p>There are now over 5 million users who are happy he did.</p>

            <p>Cronometer's success has hinged entirely on positive word-of-mouth from its users. The company is still –
                and plans to continue being – a bootstrap startup to this day.</p>
